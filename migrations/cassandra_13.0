# Add new properties
add_property "cluster_name", "string", "Test Cluster", "The name of the cluster. This is mainly used to prevent machines in one logical cluster from joining another."

add_property "num_tokens", "number", 256, "This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.\n\nIf you leave this unspecified, Cassandra will use the default of 1 token for legacy compatibility, and will use the initial_token as described below.\n\nSpecifying initial_token will override this setting.\n\nIf you already have a cluster with 1 token per node, and wish to migrate to  multiple tokens per node, see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations"

add_property "data_file_directories", "array", ["/var/lib/cassandra/data"], "Directories where Cassandra should store data on disk.  Cassandra will spread data evenly across them, subject to the granularity of the configured compaction strategy."

add_property "memtable_flush_queue_size", "number", 4, "The number of full memtables to allow pending flush, that is, waiting for a writer thread.  At a minimum, this should be set to the maximum number of secondary indexes created on a single CF."
