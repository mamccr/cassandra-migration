# Add new properties
add_property "rpc_server_type", "string", "sync", "Cassandra provides two out-of-the-box options for the RPC Server:\n\n sync  -> One thread per thrift connection. For a very large number of clients, memory will be your limiting factor. On a 64 bit JVM, 180KB is the minimum stack size per thread, and that will correspond to your use of virtual memory (but physical memory may be limited depending on use of stack space).\n\n hsha  -> Stands for 'half synchronous, half asynchronous.' All thrift clients are handled asynchronously using a small number of threads that does not vary with the amount of thrift clients (and thus scales well to many clients). The rpc requests are still synchronous (one thread per active request).\n\nThe default is sync because on Windows hsha is about 30% slower.  On Linux, sync/hsha performance is about the same, with hsha of course using less memory.\n\nAlternatively, can provide your own RPC server by providing the fully-qualified class name of an o.a.c.t.TServerFactory that can create an instance of it."
